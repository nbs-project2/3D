    <h2>What is 3D?</h2>
    <p>3D, or three dimensions, is a visual representation of objects that includes depth, height, and width, as opposed to 2D images, which only show height and width
      
      <br>3D allows for the creation of realistic figures and scenes that can be viewed from different angles, facilitating interaction and immersion. 3D stands for "three dimensions":<br>
     
      <br>height, width, and depth. Unlike a flat (2D) image, a 3D object has volume and can be rotated or viewed from different perspectives.<br>
     
      <br>3D Modeling is the process of creating digital representations of objects in three dimensions using specialized software. 
      <br>This process is used in fields such as film, video games, architecture, and medicine.
     
      <br>
      Mesh: The basic structure of a 3D object, formed by vertices, edges, and faces.
      <br>
      Texturing: The application of images to the surface of models to make them more realistic.
      <br>
      Rigging and Animation: The creation of skeletons inside 3D models to give them movement.
      <br>
      Rendering: The process of generating a 2D image from a 3D model, simulating the interaction of light.

    </p>

    <h2>How are 3D Graphics Created?</h2>
    <p> 3D graphics are created using specialized software that allows for the modeling, lighting, and texturing of objects. In addition, technologies such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3D modeling:</strong> The process of creating shapes in three dimensions.</li>
      <li><strong>3D Animation:</strong> Adding movement to modeled objects.</li>
      <li><strong>Rendering:</strong> The process of generating realistic or stylized images from 3D models.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR):</strong> Uses 3D graphics to create immersive experiences in virtual environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3D cube Graphic</h2>
    <p> On this page, you can see a 3D cube that rotates constantly.</p>

    <div class="cubo-container">
      <div class="cubo">
        <div class="cara frente"></div>
        <div class="cara atras"></div>
        <div class="cara izquierda"></div>
        <div class="cara derecha"></div>
        <div class="cara arriba"></div>
        <div class="cara abajo"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>3D aplication</h3>
    <p> The applications of 3D are vast and found in many fields, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Film and Entertainment:</strong> Animation and special effects in movies and video games.</li>
      <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Visualization of organs and internal structures for diagnostics.</li>
      <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Modeling and visualization of buildings and urban landscapes.</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Creation of interactive simulations and 3D visualizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p> The world of 3D has revolutionized the way we interact with digital media. As technology advances, 3D continues to be a powerful tool for creating immersive experiences and detailed visualizations across a wide range of fields.</p>
